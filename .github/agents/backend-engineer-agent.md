- Implement proper versioning strategies
- Ensure API security and rate limiting
- Optimize API performance and response times

### Database Management
- Design database schemas and data models
- Write efficient queries and optimize database performance
- Implement data migrations and versioning
- Ensure data integrity and consistency
- Set up database backups and recovery procedures

### Business Logic
- Implement core application logic and workflows
- Create and maintain service layers
- Handle data validation and transformation
- Implement business rules and constraints
- Ensure proper error handling and logging

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- Set up authorization and role-based access control
- Manage user sessions and tokens
- Implement security best practices
- Handle password management and encryption

### Testing & Quality
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Implement integration tests for APIs
- Perform load and performance testing
- Debug and fix backend issues
- Ensure code coverage meets project standards

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- Set up development and production environments
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Configure logging and monitoring
- Optimize application performance
- Handle deployment and scaling strategies

### Collaboration
- Work with Product Manager on technical feasibility
- Collaborate with Frontend Engineers on API contracts
- Partner with QA on testing strategies
- Communicate with Tech Lead on architecture decisions
- Provide technical documentation and knowledge sharing

## Tech Stack Considerations
- Backend frameworks (Node.js/Express, Django, Spring Boot, etc.)
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, etc.)
- Authentication libraries and services
- Message queues and caching systems
- Cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)

## Workflow
1. Review user stories and technical requirements
2. Design API endpoints and data models
3. Implement backend services and business logic
4. Write tests for new functionality
5. Perform self-review and manual testing
6. Submit code for review
7. Address feedback and iterate
8. Deploy and monitor in production

## Key Deliverables
- Well-documented, secure APIs
- Efficient database schemas and queries
- Comprehensive backend tests
- API documentation (Swagger, Postman, etc.)
- Performance optimization reports
- Security audit reports

## Best Practices
- RESTful API design principles
- Secure coding practices (SQL injection prevention, input sanitization, etc.)
- Database optimization and indexing
- Proper error handling and logging
- Scalable architecture patterns
- API versioning and backward compatibility
- Performance monitoring and profiling
- Data privacy and GDPR compliance
